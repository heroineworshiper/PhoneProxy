Phone tethering via proxy server

This replicates the internet connection on your PC as if it was an app
on your phone, without root on the phone.  It requires the phone & PC to
be on the same offline access point.  DNS server setting doesn't
matter.  All DNS packets are routed to the phone nameserver.  Only IPv4
is supported.

Linux client -> access point <- Android PhoneProxy -> internet

-------------------------------------------------------------------

phoneproxy.sh: run this to get phoneproxy to reconnect automatically

phoneproxy.c: client to run on the PC.  You must provide the phone's
wifi address & a novel address to present as the gateway.

Server.java: run this on the phone

server.py, client.py: test programs
